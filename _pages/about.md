I am currently a Ph.D. student in Information Technology at Federation University Australia under Prof. Xia.

education
======
I got my Master degree from Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China, in 2017. In 2005, I enrolled to Bachelor of Telecommunication Engineering at Information and Engineering University. I have taken and learn by myself a lot of technology courses. After course study, I started my Master research project under the supervision of Professor Daming Wang. n my Master thesis “A UWB Single Station Positioning Technology Based on Compressive Sensing”, I proposed a new positioning method based on Bayesian Compressive Sensing. In that work, I used compressive sample rate to achieve good position results. The major results of my Master research project were published in the Journal of Terahertz Science and Electronic Information Technology (2017), with me being the first author.ina Postgraduate Electronic Design Contest, East China, 2016.

work
======
After graduation, I was employed as a soft engineer by Vanke Service, the top one service company in China. During these four years, I built a series of successful software applications used by more than one hundred thousand people, utilizing the cutting edge technologies in computer science such as model-driven user interface, data visualization, asynchronous programming. From 2021 I worked as a senior software engineer for Unicorn Company Lalamove. I led an engineering team to build the informatics system for the whole company.
